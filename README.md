# Letterboxd-Rating-Predictor(Work in Progress)
Currently, Letterboxd has a private API that cannot be distributed for data analysis so I will scrape movie data off of LetterBoxd using BeatifulSoap and Requests through Python to get the data from the HTML. I will then use MongoDB to store my data as it has a respective library in Python and will be easy to use and update. With this, I will create an API that I plan to use through a website created with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 

Score Calculator:
The algorithm that I will develop to predict a score will take in the 5 most important cast members, the director, producers, writers, studios, genres, and the score for the individual movie. I will do this for the top 10,000-50,000 movies. When calculating a new score, it will take the average score (with a slight bias towards their more popular films) for all movies that each cast member, director, and all other fields scraped fit into. For example, if I want a movie with Stanley Kubrick directing starring Ryan Gosling, it will take the average of Kubrick's movies and create a score as well as a score for Ryan Gosling. These scores will then be combined again and be weighted for their importance. Currently, I plan to make the director weighted the most and the genre to be weighted the least.
